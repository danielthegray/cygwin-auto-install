cygwin-auto-install
===================

Automated cygwin install. Just download the project as a zip file, extract and run cygwin-install.bat to install cygwin + apt-cyg + packages required for apt-cyg + optional packages.

You can edit the batch file to specify which optional packages you'd like installed.

I (Daniel) added folder symlinking and some environment setup that was to my liking.
